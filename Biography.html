				So I'm about to share the <em>picture of my life</em>.<sup>1</sup> It all started when the time I was born in <strong>Bulacan</strong>.<sup>2</sup> At first I don't know how things work when I was <sub>4 years old</sub>.<sup>3</sup> I admit I was a bit <dfn>pain</dfn> in the ass at that time.<sup>4</sup> I assume <strong>everybody</strong> relates to a situation when they're still <sub>kids</sub> they want to get <strong>everything they want</strong>.<sup>5</sup> Also I remember when I was four I don't know the real face of my dad.<sup>6</sup> It is because <dfn>don't <del>see things clearly</del> at that time</dfn>, literally.<sup>7</sup> At that time I'm actually a bit playful but <em>lazy</em> when it comes to studying.<sup>8</sup> I guess those are memoirs of being an elementary <sub>kid</sub>.<sup>9</sup> Well <em>cliche life</em>, because during my elementary years I was actually a victim of <strong>bullying</strong>.<sup>10</sup> Yup! Sad life as a kid.<sup>11</sup> But all over the years of being bullied by my classmates, I managed to <strong>build up courage</strong> for myself.<sup>12</sup> I tried to <em>fight back for the sake of peace in my environment</em>.<sup>13</sup> On the last year of my elementary years I realized that I have to <sup>grow up</sup>.<sup>14</sup> <strong>Not because of sudden realization but because the advice of my parents and elders in my family</strong>.<sup>15</sup> <ins>On that time I met pressure</ins>.<sup>16</sup> But before I face the reality I wanted to achieve something; <strong>it's about joining the tennis club</strong>.<sup>17</sup> There’s been a tryout before getting in the team but unfortunately <del>I wasn't able to get in</del>.<sup>18</sup> After all the rejection of joining the team, I said to myself <em>"not to give or else I will be a forever sore loser"</em>.<sup>19</sup> I don't know what kind of <dfn>mindset</dfn> I have back when I was a child but I think it helps me to build up my <strong>persistent spirit</strong>.<sup>20</sup> I almost forgot during my grade 6 year I also fond of drawing things like <i>anime and stuff</i>.<sup>21</sup> Okay, moving on to my teenage years.<sup>22</sup><br>

			<p>During my high school years I've been involved on a lot of different school activities like <ins><em>selling our products during nutrition week every year, joining to intramurals, cheering in a cheer dance competition, and etc</em></ins>.<sup>1</sup> On my 2nd year of high school I again wanted to join the tennis club, <b>assuming that time I'll be officially accepted</b>.<sup>2</sup> I got in, but of course for me to be able to <strong>strengthen</strong> myself I need to <ins>train</ins>.<sup>3</sup> Not just some ordinary training where you just jog 10-15 minutes every day but <ins><b>a training where you need to run 10x in a 5 story building, swing a racquet for 1 hour, run around the court for 2 hours, and etc</b></ins>.<sup>4</sup> Yup! It is an exhaustion together with my team mates but I think it's a total <em>good worth</em> of training for the provincial match.<sup>5</sup> Then after the months of training the day of the match came.<sup>6</sup> <em>Sad but acceptable story</em>, <del>I wasn't able to win the match that time</del>.<sup>7</sup> I was actually thinking if I'm weak or is it just because my opponent was a <strong>pro</strong>, or is it because I wasn't able to swing my racquet properly.<sup>8</sup> But the reality is I was having <u>thigh cramps</u> during the match.<sup>9</sup> I don't want to tell my coach because <strong>I don't want to disappoint</strong> my team.<sup>10</sup> <em>Seriously</em>, what kind of player who plays on a match with <del>cramps</del> on his thigh.<sup>11</sup> After that I just turned tennis into a hobby and decided to go on <em>music</em>.<sup>12</sup> On my 3rd to 4th I was actually involved to a band formed by my friends.<sup>13</sup> I'm actually handling <u>rhythm guitar</u> that time but decided to choose the <u>bass guitar</u>.<sup>14</sup> . And during those years I was able to play on stage at <b>Quirino Grand Stand</b>.<sup>15</sup> Then during those years I was able to have a network of friends.<sup>16</sup> Also I was able to study <kbd>programming</kbd> and editing on our school.<sup>17</sup> That time I actually realized that I have to face <strong>pressure</strong> and <strong>responsibilities</strong>, but of course I need to let <em>passion</em> in for me to be able to pass those <u>challenges</u>.<sup>18</sup> Fast forward to college life.<sup>19</sup><br></p>

			<p>For the first two years of my college I made a lot of <u>friends</u>, met people who knows a lot when it comes to <kbd>computer systems</kbd>, and etc.<sup>1</sup> Early in my first year of college I was a bit <b><em><s>meh</s></em></b>.<sup>2</sup> Imagine the situation where you go first day at school and sit inside the classroom with a bunch of <strong>rowdy strangers</strong>.<sup>3</sup> For me I'm actually used in a <em>peaceful environment</em> like my hometown in <i>Sta. Maria Bulacan</i>, but to that kind of place in <i>Manila</i> where there are a lot of different kinds of <strong>pollution</strong>.<sup>4</sup> I almost forgot, the reason I study in Manila is because I wasn't able to get a slot in <del>Bulacan State University</del>.<sup>5</sup> Going back to my first year.<sup>6</sup> After first day and the days after that I actually caught a <strong><u>dengue fever</u></strong>, it was after our prelim.<sup>7</sup> . I guess that is the reason why my G.W.A. <sub>drop down</sub>, but <em>no worries</em> it's not actually a G.W.A. where you hit 50/50.<sup>8</sup> After my first year, I met a few friends then decided to form a group whenever there's a project in our class.<sup>9</sup> I know we're not that kind of a <sub>large</sub> group of people to hang out but I think it's cool to hang around with them.<sup>10</sup> After my 1st semester of being a 2nd Year College, my group decided to form decided to form a <u>thesis group</u>.<sup>11</sup> But there's a <strong>problem</strong>, we need another member to be able to form four members in a group.<sup>12</sup> So time passed by, a student in our section joined our group.<sup>13</sup> There's a reason why this <del>guy</del> joined our group, not because he wanted to join our group but because he is the only who <ins>doesn't have group yet</ins>.<sup>14</sup> For the <strong>sake</strong> my co-members decision, we let that <del>guy</del> join in our group.<sup>15</sup> To cut long story short.<sup>16</sup> Our group for our small thesis was able to <strong><u>survive</u></strong> on the whole semester.<sup>17</sup></br>
